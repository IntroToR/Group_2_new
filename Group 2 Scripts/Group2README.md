# Group\_2

Our group has chosen to look at The Office data set from tidytuesday that was inserted into the tidytuesday network on Marth 17th, 2020. We chose this data set because of its accessibility to manipulate and transform along with its clear content that our group understood easily. Other data sets were cumbersome with a large number of variables well beyond the scope of what we wanted to investigate as well as complicated to clean due to the overall size and number of N/A entries.

The Office data set allowed us to clearly evaluate a data set that had distinct relationships between its variables. This helped members of our group visualize the end goal of this project, specifically the graphs that were to be produced, and gave a clear direction to our transformations on the data set.

As can be seen in the repository assigned to Group 2, we organized our work into four distinct folders to better separate our work and final products. The descriptive scripts created to transform the data set as well as explain the actions within are found in the "Group 2 Scripts" folder. All of the unique data sets or data frames created through our work are included in the "Group 2 Data" folder for further examination. "Group 2 Figures" includes all of the graphs and charts that our group used to visualize and represent this data set while "Group 2 Text Files" houses the summary statistics and means of the variables in question. The select graph posted on Twitter by our group will be posted by Keith Ehnle @CPSC441_Group_2 and includes the hashtags `#tidytuesday` and `#RStat` as instructed.
